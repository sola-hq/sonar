  A high-performance, open-source data platform for the Solana ecosystem.
</h3>

---

Sonar is a modular indexing and analytics platform for the Solana blockchain. It does the heavy lifting of capturing, processing, and serving real-time and historical on-chain data, so you can focus on building your application.

## ü§î Why Sonar?

Accessing reliable, low-latency, and comprehensive DeFi data on Solana is complex and expensive. Sonar solves this by providing a self-hostable, open-source solution that is both powerful and flexible.

**Who is this for?**

*   **DeFi Developers**: Build sophisticated applications on top of a solid data foundation.
*   **Data Analysts & Researchers**: Query rich, granular historical data to uncover market insights.
*   **Arbitrageurs & MEV Searchers**: Get a real-time firehose of on-chain events to feed your trading strategies.
*   **Infrastructure Providers**: Offer reliable data endpoints as a service to your users.

## ‚ú® Features

- **High-Performance Ingestion**: Connects directly to a Solana Geyser plugin for microsecond-level data capture.
- **Modular & Scalable**: Services for ingestion, API, and scheduling are independent crates, allowing them to be scaled separately.
- **Multi-Protocol DEX Support**: Includes processors for a wide range of DEX protocols on Solana (Raydium, Orca, Meteora, etc.).
- **Real-time & Historical Data**: Provides WebSocket streams for live data and a REST API for historical queries.
- **Extensible by Design**: Easily add support for new protocols or data types.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Sonar is designed for easy setup. Follow these steps to get your local development environment running.

### Prerequisites

- **Rust**: See [rust-toolchain.toml](./rust-toolchain.toml) for the exact version.
- **Docker & Docker Compose**: For running all services (Sonar components, Redis, ClickHouse).
- **Access to Solana Data**:
    - For full, low-latency performance: A Solana node with the [Geyser plugin](https://solana.com/docs/rpc/geyser-plugins).
    - For basic functionality and development: A standard Solana RPC endpoint.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sola-hq/sonar-rs.git
cd sonar-rs
```

### 2. Configure Your Environment

Copy the example environment file and fill in the required values. **Crucially, ensure your `.env` file contains correct connection strings for Redis and ClickHouse, as these are now managed by Docker Compose.**

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Example .env entries for Docker Compose:
# REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379/
# DATABASE_URL=clickhouse://default:@clickhouse:8123/default
```

### 3. Run All Services with Docker Compose (Recommended)

This is the easiest way to get all Sonar components and their dependencies (Redis, ClickHouse) running locally.

```bash
docker-compose up --build # --build will build the sonar images if not present
```

Once started, you can access the API at `http://localhost:8000/swagger-ui` (or your configured API port).

### Manual Build & Run (Advanced)

If you prefer to run services outside of Docker Compose, you can build and run them manually.

Build the project in release mode:

```bash
cargo build --release sonar
```

Each service can be run using the main `sonar` binary in a separate terminal. Ensure your Redis and ClickHouse instances are running and accessible.

**Start the API Server:**
```bash
./target/release/sonar api
# or
cargo run -p sonar-api
```

**Start the Ingestor (Node):**
```bash
# or
cargo run -p sonar-ingestor
```

**Start the Scheduler:**
```bash
./target/release/sonar scheduler candlestick
# or
cargo run -p sonar-scheduler
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The system is composed of several key services that communicate via a message queue (e.g., Redis).
